# Converting Churland Lab data to NWB format

## Key Investigators

- James Roach (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)
- Anne Churchland (CSHL)

## Project Description

Create as workflow to reformat trialized Ca imaging/ behavioral data to NWB formatted data.

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

1. Objective A: Reformat continuous Ca and behavioral data to reference an absolute time
1. Objective B: Populate new absolute time with trial start/ end times and discrete events/ behaviors

## Approach and Plan

1. Convert stimulus time referenced Ca data to continuous-time data.
1. Add trial start/end times as intervals in absolute time.
1. Add analog behavior data as in step 1.
1. Add stimulus times/ go tones/ etc as events in absolute time
1. Add discrete behaviors as events in absolute time
